/// A section + offset based address class.
///
/// The `SBAddress` class allows addresses to be relative to a section
/// that can move during runtime due to images (executables, shared
/// libraries, bundles, frameworks) being loaded at different
/// addresses than the addresses found in the object file that
/// represents them on disk. There are currently two types of addresses
/// for a section:
///
/// * file addresses
/// * load addresses
///
/// File addresses represents the virtual addresses that are in the 'on
/// disk' object files. These virtual addresses are converted to be
/// relative to unique sections scoped to the object file so that
/// when/if the addresses slide when the images are loaded/unloaded
/// in memory, we can easily track these changes without having to
/// update every object (compile unit ranges, line tables, function
/// address ranges, lexical block and inlined subroutine address
/// ranges, global and static variables) each time an image is loaded or
/// unloaded.
///
/// Load addresses represents the virtual addresses where each section
/// ends up getting loaded at runtime. Before executing a program, it
/// is common for all of the load addresses to be unresolved. When a
/// `DynamicLoader` plug-in receives notification that shared libraries
/// have been loaded/unloaded, the load addresses of the main executable
/// and any images (shared libraries) will be  resolved/unresolved. When
/// this happens, breakpoints that are in one of these sections can be
/// set/cleared.
